When I first started using TiddlyWiki a long time ago, I wanted TiddlyWiki to be able to visualize data. I wanted to generate charts directly from the data in the tiddlers, I wanted to depict the logical relationships between tiddlers, I wanted to be able to count word clouds, I wanted to be able to describe the data in an intuitive way...

Unfortunately, despite the official [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) plugin, it is not yet within the reach of the average user: the plugin only wraps the JS library and gives only two simple examples of its use. d3.js is a highly free but therefore expensive to learn visualization library, and to use it for various visualization tools, you need to write standalone controls using JavaScript, which is too geeky for the average user.

So I import another well-known visualization library [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) to provide a less complex and more extensible visualization framework for the average user by leveraging ECharts' (relatively) ease of configuration and use and the richness of its visualization. That's how this project started.

The first author of this project is [Gk0Wk](https://github.com/Gk0Wk), and this is also an open source project using the MIT open source license , the project uri is https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/tw-echarts. I just built a framework that makes it easy to use ECharts, but it's up to everyone who uses it to decide exactly how to visualize it and what data they can visualize. So **feel free to share your visualization components (explained below) in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/tw-echarts/discussions), or make suggestions in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/tw-echarts/issues)**. Looking forward to your creative new ideas!
